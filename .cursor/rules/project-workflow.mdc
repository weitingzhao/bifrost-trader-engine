# Project Workflow (项目运行工作流)

When working on **planning**, **execution**, **phase acceptance**, or **documentation** for this project, follow the workflow defined in **docs/plans/PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md**. For **where to find** each document by task type, use **docs/index.md** (document index) and **.cursor/rules/doc-index.mdc**.

## Stable triangle (do not change unless requirements or architecture change)

- **docs/REQUIREMENTS.md** — product requirements (R-M*, R-C*, R-H*, R-B*, R-A*).
- **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** — system architecture and run environment (§2).
- **docs/PLAN_NEXT_STEPS.md** — phased plan aligned with requirements (stages, acceptance criteria, test cases).

Do **not** modify these three documents when:
- Implementing a phase, running tests, or updating "current progress" or "milestone timeline".
- Doing phase assessment or marking a phase as done.

Modify them **only** when the **user (or project owner) explicitly** requests a change in **product requirements** or **hardware / run environment / architecture**. After such a change, keep the three documents consistent.

## What to update during execution and assessment

- **Current project progress** (阶段完成状态), **milestone timeline** (项目里程碑时间线), and **assessment conclusions** are maintained in **docs/plans/PHASE_ASSESSMENT.md**.
- After completing or accepting a phase, update **PHASE_ASSESSMENT.md** (e.g. implementation/acceptance dates, milestone table). Do **not** add "current progress" or "milestone timeline" back into PLAN_NEXT_STEPS.md.

## Decision after assessment

- Whether to **proceed to the next phase** or **adjust requirements/architecture** is decided by the **project owner**. The agent only updates PHASE_ASSESSMENT and follows the owner’s instruction (continue to next phase vs. update the stable triangle).
