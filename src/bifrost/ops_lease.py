"""Self-healing Ops control lease for Socket Services health heartbeats.

Each service calls ``maintain_health_host`` on every service-heartbeat tick.
If the HOST field is missing from the service health hash (e.g. after a Redis
restart or key eviction), it is re-written automatically without waiting for an
Ops operator to click Start again.

``maintain_service_ops_lease`` is kept for backward-compat but is deprecated;
all Socket Services now write directly to their ``bifrost:health:*`` hash.
